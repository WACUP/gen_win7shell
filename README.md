This is a modified release of the Win7shell plug-in originally provided by Attila Magyari (TheSaw) & done so with his kind permission. This version has been provided to allow for better integration with the WACUP releases (sometimes radically so compared to the prior standlone version of the plug-in e.g. configuration is done via a WACUP managed 'Taskbar' preferences node).

The source code is provided under the GPLv3 as per the original license of the source code. It is provided as-is with all changes applied over the top of the existing source code (note: some files have been changed &/or removed compared to the original source code release). The Winamp 5.55 SDK as well as some of the newer Winamp 5.666 header files from <a target="_blank" href="https://getwacup.com/sdk/">here</a> are required to build this release.
